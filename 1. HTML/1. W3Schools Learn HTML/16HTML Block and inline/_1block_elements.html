    <p style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</p>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black; height: 20px;"></div>

    <p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full
        width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
